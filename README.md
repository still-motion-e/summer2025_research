#### cleaned_coords.py
  this program is a cleaned of version of Coords. py
#### Coords.py
  this reconstructs mass from all pairs of two given particle data in collider coordinates
#### cambridge_aachen.py
  this is an implementation of the cambridge aachen clustering algorithm R = .4. (__this is not a correct implementation__)
#### cambridge_aachen_cleaned.py
  this is a cleaned version of cambridge_aachen.py, with the same incorrect implementation
#### cambridge_aachen_remade.py
  this fixes the implementation of the distance measure from cambridge_aachen.py
#### instructions.MD
  small notes to myself as i am working
#### Eta_Phi_PT_Mass_objects.txt
  data file with heading 
#### No_Header_Eta_Phi_PT_Mass_objects.txt
  same as Eta_Phi_PT_Mass_objects but with removed header
#### iter_counting.py
  much like Coords.py, but can do arbitrary numbers of particle combinations
#### fix_anti_kt.py
  an implementation of kt, ant-kt, and cambridge_aachen, only works for cambridge_aachen w/ n=0 currently
